# Ezoic Integration Setup Guide

This document outlines the steps needed to complete the Ezoic ads monetization setup for the Resume Generation site.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Updates (index.html)
- Replaced Google AdSense meta tag with Ezoic meta tags
- Replaced Google AdSense script with Ezoic initialization script
- Added site verification meta tag placeholder

### 2. Component Updates
- Created new `EzoicAd` component to replace `GoogleAd`
- Updated `App.tsx` to use Ezoic ads with strategic placements:
  - Sidebar ad in the input section
  - Top ad above results
  - Bottom ad below results
- Added header banner ad in `Header.tsx`

### 3. Configuration Files
- Created `utils/ezoicConfig.ts` for managing ad placements
- Added ad placement configurations for different positions

## Required Manual Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Ezoic Account Setup
1. Sign up for an Ezoic account at https://www.ezoic.com/
2. Add your domain to Ezoic dashboard
3. Complete site verification process

### 2. Get Site-Specific Integration Code
1. Once site is approved, get your site-specific Ezoic integration code from the dashboard
2. Replace the placeholder in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <meta name="ezoic-site-verification" content="YOUR_ACTUAL_VERIFICATION_CODE">
   ```

### 3. Update Ezoic Script
1. Replace the placeholder script in `index.html` with the actual Ezoic script provided in your dashboard
2. The script will typically look like:
   ```html
   <script data-ezscrex="false" data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">
     // Your site-specific Ezoic code here
   </script>
   ```

### 4. Configure Ad Placements
1. In your Ezoic dashboard, configure the ad placements matching the placeholders:
   - `header-banner`
   - `resume-builder-sidebar`
   - `resume-result-top`
   - `resume-result-bottom`

### 5. Test Integration
1. Deploy the site with Ezoic integration
2. Test ad loading and placement
3. Monitor performance in Ezoic dashboard

## Ad Placement Strategy

The current setup includes strategic ad placements:

1. **Header Banner**: Small ad for brand visibility
2. **Sidebar**: Medium ad in the input section where users spend time
3. **Result Top**: Small ad before showing generated content
4. **Result Bottom**: Medium ad after users view the generated resume

## Benefits of Ezoic Integration

- **AI-Driven Optimization**: Ezoic uses machine learning to optimize ad placements
- **Better Revenue**: Typically provides higher RPM than traditional AdSense
- **Site Speed**: Ezoic provides caching and performance improvements
- **A/B Testing**: Automatic testing of different ad configurations
- **Detailed Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting on ad performance

## Next Steps

1. Complete the manual setup steps above
2. Monitor ad performance after deployment
3. Adjust ad placements based on Ezoic recommendations
4. Consider additional ad formats (video, native) as traffic grows
