# Ads.txt file for resumegen.example.com
# 
# This file was generated as a placeholder because the Ezoic ads.txt service
# could not be reached or the domain is not yet configured with Ezoic.
# 
# To complete the setup:
# 1. Ensure your domain (resumegen.example.com) is registered with Ezoic
# 2. Configure Ezoic ads.txt management for your site
# 3. Re-run this script: npm run update-ads-txt resumegen.example.com
# 
# Alternative setup methods:
# - Use server redirects (see vercel.json or _redirects files)
# - Manually copy content from: https://srv.adstxtmanager.com/19390/resumegen.example.com
# 
# For more information, see EZOIC_SETUP.md

# Placeholder entry - replace with actual Ezoic ads.txt content
